# YoutubeBookmarks
Save timestamp specific bookmarks on your favourite YouTube videos!

A Chrome Extension built to bookmark specific timestamps within YouTube videos directly through the video player. Allows for multiple bookmarks within one video. Users can jump to a bookmark from any tab and will be redirected to the video as well as the exact timestamp they've saved. When on a youtube video, only the bookmarks for that video are displayed within the extension to maintain a more focused User Experience.
